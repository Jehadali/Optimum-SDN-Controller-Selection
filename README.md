# Optimum-SDN-Controller-Selection
These experiments compare two controllers obtained through feature based selection of ANP and AHP. 
The comparison of the controllers is made in Real-Ineternet and Brite Topologies.
The Brite topologies are created with Brite Software and converted to Mininet with a conversion Module.
The graphical information of real world internet topologies is used to create Mininet compatible topologies.

Further updation will be made soon.
