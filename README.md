# Optimum-SDN-Controller-Selection

The optimal SDN controller selection methodology is explained here.


The experiments are performed for checking the QoS Improvement.


The delay calculation module finds the delay between the source and destination hosts using tcpdumps


B_1 and B_2 are the topologies generated via Brite


The topolgoy conversion module converts the topolgies generated via Brite i.e. B_1 and B_2 to Mininet


The D-ITG calculates the delay between the source and destination during the high traffic load scenario.
